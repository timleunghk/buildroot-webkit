This patch is mandatory for all Espial projects.

** This patch requires editing for each project to list the device numbers. **

This patch adds the ability to pre-allocate dynamic major device numbers for
block devices, such that the major device number for any given driver
becomes predictable, even if it asks for a dynamically-allocated number.

This is critical to avoid assignments changing between builds and when other
kernel options are modified and when kernel modules are added or removed.

The list of assignments goes in the array in the second file.  You can edit
the patch directly, provided you remember to adjust the line count at the
top of the file patch!

This patch should apply cleanly to any kernel from 3.14 onwards (at least)
