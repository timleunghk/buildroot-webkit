	  Gateway forwarding a Linn Songcast audio stream to MPD.

	  sc2mpd is designed to work with upmpdcli, with which it
	  provides a Songcast Receiver interface usable from any
	  Songcast Sender such as the Windows or Mac OS X Linn
	  Songcast applications.

	  The package also contains a reverse gateway, mpd2sc,
	  forwarding audio played by mpd to a Songcast Sender, mostly
	  useful for multiroom synchronized play.
