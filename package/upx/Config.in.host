          UPX is an advanced executable file compressor. UPX will typically
          reduce the file size of programs and DLLs by around 50%-70%, thus
          reducing disk space, network load times, download times etc. The
          current version can compress executables for DOS, Linux/ELF (i386,
          amd64, ppc32) and some other files for different OS.
