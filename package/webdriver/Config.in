           This is a tool for automating web application testing,
	   and in particular to verify that they work as expected.
	   It aims to provide a friendly API that's easy to explore and understand,
	   easier to use than the Selenium-RC (1.0) API, 
	   which will help to make your tests easier to read and maintain.
